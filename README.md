# GameOfLife
This was written over 10 years ago for an artist friend after I showed him 
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
He mused on it a little and liked the idea of repeating patterns but found it 
difficult to experiment with large-scale pieces, so I wrote this for him.

# Technologies
From front to back, the code is written in WinForms and C#.

# How to Run
Open the solution file (GameOfLife.sln) in Visual Studio. Click 'Run', and then
'Set Pattern'.

The number shown (5 by default) can be changed, after which you should press
'Enter' and the form will reload with a larger area. Clicking anywhere in the
grid underneath will select and deselect that square, and clicking 'Done' will
load the pattern as dictated by my friend all those years ago.
